Diverse life cycles and embryonic patterns are characteristic for Annelids, which are one of the main model taxon for studying development and evolution of a large bilaterian clade, namely Spiralia/Lophotrochozoa. Comprehensive transcriptome profiling has been performed for only four annelid species (Chou et al., 2016; Martín-Zamora et al., 2023) featuring indirect planctotrophic (Owenia fusiformis), lecitotrophic (Platynereis dumerilii, Capitella teleta) or direct development (Dimorphilus gyrociliatus). Still many other fundamental processes of body plan establishment have been outside the focus of published works, due in part to the limitations of the model organisms used. 
One of the most intriguing and poorly understood issues of spiralian embryogenesis is the change in maternal to zygotic gene expression. The marine annelid Platynereis’ transcriptome profiling demonstrated that maternal to zygotic transition is comprised of several waves of zygotic expression. The major transition to the zygotic landscape coincide with the end of the 6th or 7th cell cycle, and at the transition to bilaterally symmetric cell divisions, i.e. after completion of the spiral cleavage program. Investigating whether this regulatory circuit is conserved between unequally spiral cleaving, lecitotrophic embryo of Platynereis and equally cleaving, planctotrophic embryo of Ophelia would contribute substantially to the field of evolutionary developmental biology of the Spiralia clade.
